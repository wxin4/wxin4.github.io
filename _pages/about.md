## Welcome to the coding world! It's Wei here!

It is the site you'll love if you want to know more about the thinking path of coding. All articles are tech-related and very detailed step by step, especially the leetcode part.

Speaks of leetcode, I'm currently doing exercise using the [Top 100 Liked Questions](https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-100-liked-questions/) in leetcode which I think is great for people who are going to have interviews soon because it covers all kinds of problems for you to practice before an interview. I will definitely continue updating this catagory while I'm practicing leetcode and give you full tutorial of each of the problems so that you can get where I am wherever you get stuck.

Besides, there is another catagory to share with you. It is called "Pragmatic Knowledge" which covers all kinds of real stuff about programming. This includes coding tools, environment building, different languages usage, coding skills improvement, etc. These solid information will help programmers get better in the dimension of both scope and scale.

To sum up, this site has very few tags to click on so it looks clean and clear. There is a search button on the upper right corner as well so that you can directly search the articles I published and go from there.

Alright guys, I really looking forward to helping every code lovers, including me, get better in the future career. Enjoy the site and best of luck everyone!!
