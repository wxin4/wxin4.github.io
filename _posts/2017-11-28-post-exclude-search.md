This post should appear in the search index because it has the following YAML Front Matter:

search: true


**Note:** `search: false` only works to exclude posts when using **Lunr** as a search provider.
{: .notice--info}

To exclude files when using **Algolia** as a search provider add an array to `algolia.files_to_exclude` in your `_config.yml`. For more configuration options be sure to check their [full documentation](https://community.algolia.com/jekyll-algolia/options.html).
