Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

## Question

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Example:
```
Input: {1,#,2,3}, {1,2,#,3}
Output: 
Explaination: 
the first tree:
  1
    \                
     2                
    /                 
   3   
the second tree:
    1
   /
  2
 /
3
The leaf value sequence is: [3], so the same


Input: {1,#,2,3}, {1,2,#,3}
Output: 
Explaination: 
the first tree:
  1
    \                
     2                
    /                 
   3   
the second tree:
   1
  / \                
 2   3    
The first leaf value sequence is: [3], the second tree is: [2, 3], so it is not the same
```

## Analyzation
`Recursion`

Simple problem. If the node has no children, append that val to the corresponding list and do the same thing for the other tree.

## The Code
```
class Solution:
    """
    @param root1: the first tree
    @param root2: the second tree
    @return: returns whether the leaf sequence is the same
    """
    def leafSimilar(self, root1, root2):
        # write your code here.
        if root1 is None or root2 is None:
            return False
        
        result1 = []
        result2 = []
            
        self.dfs(root1, result1)
        self.dfs(root2, result2)
        
        return result1 == result2
    
    
    def dfs(self, node, result):
        if node is None:
            return
        
        self.dfs(node.left, result)
        self.dfs(node.right, result)
            
        if node.left is None and node.right is None:
            result.append(node.val)
            return
```

## Time & Space Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n). Remember that the best case of a Binary Tree is O(logn) since it is a balanced tree but the worst case is O(n) because it can skew to only one side.
- Space complexity: O(n). Remember that the space complexity is always about how many nodes there are in a Binary Tree. If the tree is well-balanced then it is O(logn) but the worst case will be O(n).
